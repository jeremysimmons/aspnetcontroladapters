Based on concepts in the original CSSFriendly project (http://www.codeplex.com/cssfriendly), this project will provide an alternate set of control adapters that render your ASP.Net controls using well-documented semantic HTML and CSS.

Current control adapters available:

  * CheckBoxList (partially implemented)
  * RadioButtonList (partially implemented)
  * [Menu](Menu.md) (very limited implemented)
  * [Wizard](Wizard.md) (very limited implemented)
